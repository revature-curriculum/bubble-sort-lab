# Lab Instructions

Implement Bubble Sort

## Running the Tests

The lab comes with tests that will verify the correct functionality. You can look at the test code to get a better sense of what the lab expects located in `src/test/java/BubbleSortTest.java`. 

To run the tests, use Maven via your shell with `mvn test` or in your IDE. The **Run** button on Replit should also run your tests. 

If you have any issues, try running `mvn dependency:resolve` and then running the tests again. 

If that doesn't work, let avi@revature.com know and do your best without the tests.

## GitHub

You can also fork and clone this lab on [GitHub](https://github.com/revature-curriculum/bubble-sort-lab) and submit a pull request when you're done.
