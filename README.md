# Lab Instructions

Here we will be constructing our own bubble sort. 
Using the `sort()` method, write in your logic for bubble sorting a series of integers. 
The method will be provided an **unsorted** array of integers as a parameter. 
What should be returned is an array in **ascending** order. 
Ex: 


`input -> [3,2,5,1,4]`

`output -> [1,2,3,4,5]`

Be sure to be mindful of the array indices as `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionsare` very common.

## Running the Tests

The lab comes with tests that will verify the correct functionality. You can look at the test code to get a better sense of what the lab expects located in `src/test/java/BubbleSortTest.java`. 

To run the tests, use Maven via your shell with `mvn test` or in your IDE. The **Run** button on Replit should also run your tests. 

If you have any issues, try running `mvn dependency:resolve` and then running the tests again. 

If that doesn't work, let avi@revature.com know and do your best without the tests.
